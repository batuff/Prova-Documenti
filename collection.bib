abstract = {Specifying photon spectra of clinical linacs using a functional form is useful for many applications, including virtual source modelling and spectral unfolding from dosimetric measurements such as transmission data or depth-dose curves. In this study, 11 functional forms from the literature are compiled and quantitatively compared. A new function is proposed which offers improvements over existing ones. The proposed function is simple, physics-based and has four free parameters, one of which is the mean incident electron kinetic energy. A comprehensive benchmark set of validated, high-precision Monte Carlo spectra is generated and used to evaluate the strengths and limitations of different functions. The benchmark set has 65 spectra (3.5-30 MV) from Varian, Elekta, Siemens, Tomotherapy, Cyberknife and research linacs. The set includes spectra on- and off-axis from linacs with and without a flattening filter, and in treatment and imaging modes. The proposed function gives the lowest spectral deviations among all functions. It reproduces the energy fluence values in each bin for the benchmark set with a normalized root-mean-square deviation of 1.7\%. The mean incident electron kinetic energy, maximum photon energy, most-probable energy and average energy are reproduced, on average, within 1.4\%, 4.3\%, 3.9\% and 0.6\% of their true values, respectively. The proposed function is well behaved when used for spectral unfolding from dosimetric data. The contribution of the 511 keV annihilation peak and the energy spread of the incident electron beam can be added as additional free parameters.},

abstract = {Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are a promising radiosensitizer agent in radiotherapy. Through a simulation performed with the Geant4 Monte Carlo code, we evaluated the dose enhancement effect of GNPs during therapies with an x-ray tube operating at 150 kV (E = 55 keV and E(max) = 150 keV) and we studied the impact of GNP diffusion out of the tumour vessels, in terms of antiangiogenic and cytotoxic effects. Firstly, a single x-ray beam was assumed to irradiate a parallelepiped volume of soft tissue, in which a GNP-doped "target" volume was placed at different depths. Average dose enhancement factors (DEF) in presence of GNPs were obtained as a function of the target depth and GNP concentration, uniformly distributed; values ranging between 1.6 for 10 mg Au/g at 0 cm and 7.2 for 200 mg Au/g at 5 cm were determined. Furtherly, a second geometry was adopted, in which a blood capillary vessel (10 $\mu$m thick and 10 $\mu$m of inner radius) was placed at the centre of a cubic volume of soft tissue; doses and DEFs to the capillary endothelium as well as to the surrounding viable tumour were evaluated, for different models of GNP diffusion. Our results indicate that the radial DEF profiles around the vessel are in close relationship with the radial profiles of GNP concentration assumed, except for at sharp gradients of concentration. DEFs at the endothelium ranged from 1.6 to 6.5, for GNP concentrations in the blood of 10 and 200 mg/ml, respectively. These data can be helpful for the development of new and more specific GNP-based radiosensitizers of potential interest in radiotherapy, exploiting the combined benefit of anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic dose enhancement effects.},

Although demonstrated for malignant cell lines the results can be applied to non-malignant cell lines as well. In particular the accumulation of the gold marker per cell has been assessed quantitatively by virtue of electron microscopy, two-dimensional X-ray fluorescence imaging techniques and X-ray CT with micrometric and sub-micrometric resolution. Moreover, utilizing these techniques the three dimensional distribution of the incorporated nanoparticles, which are sequestered in lysosomes as a permanent marker, could be determined. The latter allowed elucidation of the gold partition during mitosis and the cell size, which subsequently enabled us to define the optimal instrument settings of a compact microCT system to visualize gold loaded cells. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility of cell-tracking using X-ray CT with compact sources.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Tumor endothelial cell damage during radiation therapy may contribute significantly to tumor eradication and treatment efficacy. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) delivered preferentially to the walls of tumor blood vessels produce low-energy, short-range photoelectrons during external beam radiotherapy, boosting dose to the tumor microvasculature. In this study dosimetry at the single-cell level is used to estimate the anticipated AuNP-mediated dose enhancement to tumor endothelial cells during 6-MV X-ray irradiation.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Endothelial cells are modeled as thin slabs with 100-nm-diameter AuNPs attached within the blood vessel. The number of photoelectrons emitted per AuNP per gray of X-rays is computed at multiple points along the external beam central axis by use of a Monte Carlo-generated energy fluence spectrum. The energy deposited from AuNP emissions to the endothelium is calculated based on an analytic method incorporating the energy-loss formula of Cole. The endothelial dose enhancement factor (EDEF) is the ratio of the overall (externally plus internally generated) dose to endothelial cells in the presence of AuNPs to the dose without AuNPs (from the external beam only).

RESULTS: At 20-cm depth, the EDEF is 1.7 (70\% dose increase) for an intravascular AuNP concentration of 30 mg/g. Most of this dose enhancement arises from the low-energy (approximately 100 keV) portion of the linear accelerator X-ray spectrum. Furthermore, for AuNP concentrations ranging from 7 to 140 mg/g, EDEF values of 1.2 to 4.4 (20-340\% dose increase) are calculated.

CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to calculations assuming that AuNPs distributed homogeneously throughout the target volume (macrodosimetry), our cellular microdosimetry calculations predict a major dose enhancement to tumor microvasculature from conventional linear accelerator X-rays. This effect may enable the delivery of ablative therapeutic doses to these sensitive microstructures while maintaining established dose constraints for the organs at risk.},

Most of these works have used specific-purpose MC codes to simulate radiation transport in condensed media. PENELOPE is one of the general-purpose MC codes that has been used in many applications related to radiation dosimetry. Based on the fact that PENELOPE can carry out event-by-event coupled electron-photon transport simulations following these particles down to energies of the order of few tens of eV, we have decided to investigate the capacities of this code in the field of nanodosimetry. Single and double strand break probabilities due to the direct impact of gamma rays originated from Co60 and Cs137 isotopes and characteristic x-rays, from Al and C K-shells, have been determined by use of PENELOPE. Indirect damage has not been accounted for in this study. A human genetic material geometrical model has been developed, taking into account five organizational levels. In an article by Friedland et al. [Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 38, 39-47 (1999)], a specific-purpose MC code and a very sophisticated DNA geometrical model were used. We have chosen that work as a reference to compare our results. Single and double strand-break probabilities obtained here underestimate those reported by Friedland and co-workers by 20\%-76\% and 50\%-60\%, respectively. However, we obtain RBE values for Cs137, AlK and CK radiations in agreement with those reported in previous works [Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 38, 39-47 (1999)] and [Phys. Med. Biol. 53, 233-244 (2008)]. Some enhancements can be incorporated into the PENELOPE code to improve its results in the nanodosimetry field.},

This combination creates localized X-ray absorption and localized energy deposition of nanometer precision. We confirmed the theoretically predicted nanoscale energy deposition distribution by measuring hydroxyl radical-induced DNA strand breaks, and observed enhanced damage to a 5600-bp DNA molecule from approximately 10 chemically conjugated small gold nanoparticles under X-ray radiation.

abstract = {A recent mice study demonstrated that gold nanoparticles could be safely administered and used to enhance the tumour dose during radiation therapy. The use of gold nanoparticles seems more promising than earlier methods because of the high atomic number of gold and because nanoparticles can more easily penetrate the tumour vasculature. However, to date, possible dose enhancement due to the use of gold nanoparticles has not been well quantified, especially for common radiation treatment situations. Therefore, the current preliminary study estimated this dose enhancement by Monte Carlo calculations for several phantom test cases representing radiation treatments with the following modalities: 140 kVp x-rays, 4 and 6 MV photon beams, and 192Ir gamma rays. The current study considered three levels of gold concentration within the tumour, two of which are based on the aforementioned mice study, and assumed either no gold or a single gold concentration level outside the tumour. The dose enhancement over the tumour volume considered for the 140 kVp x-ray case can be at least a factor of 2 at an achievable gold concentration of 7 mg Au/g tumour assuming no gold outside the tumour. The tumour dose enhancement for the cases involving the 4 and 6 MV photon beams based on the same assumption ranged from about 1\% to 7\%, depending on the amount of gold within the tumour and photon beam qualities. For the 192Ir cases, the dose enhancement within the tumour region ranged from 5\% to 31\%, depending on radial distance and gold concentration level within the tumour. For the 7 mg Au/g tumour cases, the loading of gold into surrounding normal tissue at 2 mg Au/g resulted in an increase in the normal tissue dose, up to 30\%, negligible, and about 2\% for the 140 kVp x-rays, 6 MV photon beam, and 192Ir gamma rays, respectively, while the magnitude of dose enhancement within the tumour was essentially unchanged.},

abstract = {The preferential accumulation of gold nanoparticles within tumors and the increased photoelectric absorption due to the high atomic number of gold cooperatively account for the possibility of significant tumor dose enhancement during gold nanoparticle-aided radiation therapy (GNRT). Among the many conceivable ways to implement GNRT clinically, a brachytherapy approach using low-energy gamma-/x-ray sources (i.e. E(avg) 40\%) could be achievable using (125)I, 50 kVp and (169)Yb sources and gold nanoparticles. When calculated at 1.0 cm from the center of the source within a tumor loaded with 18 mg Au g(-1), macroscopic dose enhancement was 116, 92 and 108\% for (125)I, 50 kVp and (169)Yb, respectively. For a tumor loaded with 7 mg Au g(-1), it was 68, 57 and 44\% at 1 cm from the center of the source for (125)I, 50 kVp and (169)Yb, respectively. The estimated MDEF values for (169)Yb were remarkably larger than those for (192)Ir, on average by up to about 70 and 30\%, for 18 mg Au and 7 mg Au cases, respectively. The current MC study also shows a remarkable change in the photoelectron fluence and spectrum (e.g. more than two orders of magnitude) and a significant production (e.g. comparable to the number of photoelectrons) of the Auger electrons within the tumor region due to the presence of gold nanoparticles during low-energy gamma-/x-ray irradiation. The radiation sources considered in this study are currently available and tumor gold concentration levels considered in this investigation are deemed achievable. Therefore, the current results strongly suggest that GNRT can be successfully implemented via brachytherapy with low energy gamma-/x-ray sources, especially with a high dose rate (169)Yb source.},

abstract = {This study investigated the secondary electron production from a gold nanoparticle (GNP) irradiated by monoenergetic electron beams using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Spherical GNPs with diameters of 2, 50 and 100 nm in water were irradiated by monoenergetic electron beams with energies equal to 50 keV, 250 keV, 1 MeV and 4 MeV. MC simulations were performed using the Geant4 toolkit to determine the energy of the secondary electrons emitted from the GNPs. The mean effective range and deflection angle of the secondary electrons were tracked. Energy depositions inside and outside the nanoparticles due to the secondary electrons were also calculated. For comparisons, simulations were repeated by replacing the GNPs with water. Our results show that the mean effective range of secondary electrons increased with an increase of the GNP size and electron beam energy. For the electron beam energy and GNP size used in this study, the mean effective range was 0.5-15 Âµm outside the nanoparticle, which is approximately within the dimension of a living cell. The mean deflection angles varied from 78 to 83 degrees as per our MC results. The proportion of energy deposition inside the GNP versus that outside increased with the GNP size. This is different from the results obtained from a previous study using photon beams. The secondary electron energy deposition ratio (energy deposition for GNP/energy deposition for water) was found to be highest for the smallest GNP of 2 nm diameter in this study. For the energy deposited by the secondary electron, we concluded that the addition of GNPs can increase the secondary electron energy deposition in water, though most of the energy was self-absorbed by the large nanoparticles (50 and 100 nm). In addition, an electron source in the presence of GNPs does not seem to be better than photons as the yield of secondary electrons per unit mass of gold is less than water.},

RBE is a quantity relating the effectiveness of different radiations in causing cell death. LET is a measure of the rate of energy transferred to material by an ionizing particle. This relationship of these values varies for different particles. The reason for this is still inconclusive. The petitioner has made use of a toolkit for Geant4, known as Geant4-DNA, to perform track-structure analysis on a chromosome model. Geant4 is an object-oriented program for the "simulation of the passage of particles through matter" developed by CERN that makes use of Monte Carlo methods and is expanded by Geant4-DNA to handle low-energy electron physics as well as physic-chemical effects. The chromosome model, in this case, has been developed by the petitioner as a nucleus with a basic, uniform distribution of chromatin. Radiation damage to DNA, in the form of aberrations, lesions and strand breaks, can be coordinated to energy deposited or number of ionizations occurring in the target (in this case DNA or chromatin fiber). Certain threshold values have been established as indicate of different types of DNA damage. The ultimate goal of this work is to score these clusters of events against the threshold values to determine the severity of DNA damage. The final comparison of the results for different particles will provide for a better understanding of the RBE-LET relationships by improving the understanding of the underlying nanodosimetric qualities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This follow-up study aims to determine the physical parameters which govern the differential radiosensitization capacity of two tumor cell lines and one immortalized normal cell line to 1.9 nm gold nanoparticles. In addition to comparing the uptake potential, localization, and cytotoxicity of 1.9 nm gold nanoparticles, the current study also draws on comparisons between nanoparticle size and total nanoparticle uptake based on previously published data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We quantified gold nanoparticle uptake using atomic emission spectroscopy and imaged intracellular localization by transmission electron microscopy. Cell growth delay and clonogenic assays were used to determine cytotoxicity and radiosensitization potential, respectively. Mechanistic data were obtained by Western blot, flow cytometry, and assays for reactive oxygen species.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Gold nanoparticle uptake was preferentially observed in tumor cells, resulting in an increased expression of cleaved caspase proteins and an accumulation of cells in sub G(1) phase. Despite this, gold nanoparticle cytotoxicity remained low, with immortalized normal cells exhibiting an LD(50) concentration approximately 14 times higher than tumor cells. The surviving fraction for gold nanoparticle-treated cells at 3 Gy compared with that of untreated control cells indicated a strong dependence on cell type in respect to radiosensitization potential.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Gold nanoparticles were most avidly endocytosed and localized within cytoplasmic vesicles during the first 6 hours of exposure. The lack of significant cytotoxicity in the absence of radiation, and the generation of gold nanoparticle-induced reactive oxygen species provide a potential mechanism for previously reported radiosensitization at megavoltage energies.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Investigation of increased radiation dose deposition due to gold nanoparticles (GNPs) using a 3D computational cell model during x-ray radiotherapy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Two GNP simulation scenarios were set up in Geant4; a single 400 nm diameter gold cluster randomly positioned in the cytoplasm and a 300 nm gold layer around the nucleus of the cell. Using an 80 kVp photon beam, the effect of GNP on the dose deposition in five modeled regions of the cell including cytoplasm, membrane, and nucleus was simulated. Two Geant4 physics lists were tested: the default Livermore and custom built Livermore/DNA hybrid physics list. 10(6) particles were simulated at 840 cells in the simulation. Each cell was randomly placed with random orientation and a diameter varying between 9 and 13 $\mu$m. A mathematical algorithm was used to ensure that none of the 840 cells overlapped. The energy dependence of the GNP physical dose enhancement effect was calculated by simulating the dose deposition in the cells with two energy spectra of 80 kVp and 6 MV. The contribution from Auger electrons was investigated by comparing the two GNP simulation scenarios while activating and deactivating atomic de-excitation processes in Geant4.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The physical dose enhancement ratio (DER) of GNP was calculated using the Monte Carlo model. The model has demonstrated that the DER depends on the amount of gold and the position of the gold cluster within the cell. Individual cell regions experienced statistically significant (p < 0.05) change in absorbed dose (DER between 1 and 10) depending on the type of gold geometry used. The DER resulting from gold clusters attached to the cell nucleus had the more significant effect of the two cases (DER â 55). The DER value calculated at 6 MV was shown to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the DER values calculated for the 80 kVp spectrum. Based on simulations, when 80 kVp photons are used, Auger electrons have a statistically insignificant (p < 0.05) effect on the overall dose increase in the cell. The low energy of the Auger electrons produced prevents them from propagating more than 250-500 nm from the gold cluster and, therefore, has a negligible effect on the overall dose increase due to GNP.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results presented in the current work show that the primary dose enhancement is due to the production of additional photoelectrons.},

abstract = {Radiobiological models are essential components of modern radiotherapy. They are increasingly applied to optimize and evaluate the quality of different treatment planning modalities. They are frequently used in designing new radiotherapy clinical trials by estimating the expected therapeutic ratio of new protocols. In radiobiology, the therapeutic ratio is estimated from the expected gain in tumour control probability (TCP) to the risk of normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). However, estimates of TCP/NTCP are currently based on the deterministic and simplistic linear-quadratic formalism with limited prediction power when applied prospectively. Given the complex and stochastic nature of the physical, chemical and biological interactions associated with spatial and temporal radiation induced effects in living tissues, it is conjectured that methods based on Monte Carlo (MC) analysis may provide better estimates of TCP/NTCP for radiotherapy treatment planning and trial design. Indeed, over the past few decades, methods based on MC have demonstrated superior performance for accurate simulation of radiation transport, tumour growth and particle track structures; however, successful application of modelling radiobiological response and outcomes in radiotherapy is still hampered with several challenges. In this review, we provide an overview of some of the main techniques used in radiobiological modelling for radiotherapy, with focus on the MC role as a promising computational vehicle. We highlight the current challenges, issues and future potentials of the MC approach towards a comprehensive systems-based framework in radiobiological modelling for radiotherapy.},

Further on, the influence on calculated results of certain assumptions in such working hypotheses must critically be evaluated. In the present work, this issue is highlighted in two aspects for the case of DNA damage in single cells. First, yields of double-strand breaks and frequency distributions of DNA fragment lengths after ion irradiation were calculated using different assumptions on the DNA target model. Compared to a former target model now a moderate effect due to the inclusion of a spherical chromatin domain model has been found. Second, the influence of assumptions on particular geometric chromosome models on calculated chromosome aberration data is illustrated with two target-modelling approaches for this end point.},

abstract = {Radiations of high linear energy transfer (LET) have long been known to have greater biological effectiveness per unit dose than those of low LET, for a wide variety of biological effects. However, values of relative biological effectiveness depend considerably on the biological system and in some instances the values are clearly below unity. The differences between high- and low-LET radiations may be due to many factors, almost all of which are related to radiation track structure in one way or another, and some can in principle lead to qualitative as well as quantitative differences between the radiations. Explanations for LET-dependent differences in effectiveness are discussed over a variety of levels from the multicellular and cellular scale down to the DNA scale, with illustrations from radiobiological data. Information from well-defined slow light ions provide particularly useful analytic data, but practical issues extend also to neutrons and fast heavy ions, which may compound high- and low-LET features. It is suggested that effectiveness of the radiation is determined predominantly by the complex clustered damage that it produces in DNA, but that for high-LET radiations long-term effects are in some instances limited by single-track-survival probabilities of the traversed cells.},

abstract = {Radiation can cause as well as cure cancer. The risk of developing radiation-induced cancer has traditionally been estimated from cancer incidence among survivors of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.(1)) These data provide the best estimate of human cancer risk over the dose range for low linear energy transfer (LET) radiations, such as X- or gamma-rays. The situation of estimating the real biological effects becomes even more difficult in the case of high LET particles encountered in space or as the result of domestic exposure to alpha-particles from radon gas emitters or other radioactive emitters like uranium-238. Complex DNA damage, i.e., the signature of high-LET radiations comprises of closely spaced DNA lesions forming a cluster of DNA damage. The two basic groups of complex DNA damage are double strand breaks (DSBs) and non-DSB oxidative clustered DNA lesions (OCDL). Theoretical analysis and experimental evidence suggest an increased complexity and severity of complex DNA damage with increasing LET (linear energy transfer) and a high mutagenic or carcinogenic potential. Data available on the formation of clustered DNA damage (DSBs and OCDL) by high-LET radiations are often controversial suggesting a variable response to dose and type of radiation. The chemical nature and cellular repair mechanisms of complex DNA damage have been much less characterized than those of isolated DNA lesions like an oxidized base or a single strand break especially in the case of high-LET radiation. This review will focus on the induction of clustered DNA damage by high-LET radiations presenting the earlier and recent relative data.},

abstract = {Background: 5-year results of the UK Standardisation of Breast Radiotherapy (START) trials suggested that lower total doses of radiotherapy delivered in fewer, larger doses (fractions) are at least as safe and effective as the historical standard regimen (50 Gy in 25 fractions) for women after primary surgery for early breast cancer. In this prespecified analysis, we report the 10-year follow-up of the START trials testing 13 fraction and 15 fraction regimens. Methods: From 1999 to 2002, women with completely excised invasive breast cancer (pT1-3a, pN0-1, M0) were enrolled from 35 UK radiotherapy centres. Patients were randomly assigned to a treatment regimen after primary surgery followed by chemotherapy and endocrine treatment (where prescribed). Randomisation was computer-generated and stratified by centre, type of primary surgery (breast-conservation surgery or mastectomy), and tumour bed boost radiotherapy. In START-A, a regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was compared with 41Â·6 Gy or 39 Gy in 13 fractions over 5 weeks. In START-B, a regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was compared with 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks. Eligibility criteria included age older than 18 years and no immediate surgical reconstruction. Primary endpoints were local-regional tumour relapse and late normal tissue effects. Analysis was by intention to treat. Follow-up data are still being collected. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN59368779. Findings: START-A enrolled 2236 women. Median follow-up was 9Â·3 years (IQR 8Â·0-10Â·0), after which 139 local-regional relapses had occurred. 10-year rates of local-regional relapse did not differ significantly between the 41Â·6 Gy and 50 Gy regimen groups (6Â·3\%, 95\% CI 4Â·7-8Â·5 vs 7Â·4\%, 5Â·5-10Â·0; hazard ratio [HR] 0Â·91, 95\% CI 0Â·59-1Â·38; p=0Â·65) or the 39 Gy (8Â·8\%, 95\% CI 6Â·7-11Â·4) and 50 Gy regimen groups (HR 1Â·18, 95\% CI 0Â·79-1Â·76; p=0Â·41). In START-A, moderate or marked breast induration, telangiectasia, and breast oedema were significantly less common normal tissue effects in the 39 Gy group than in the 50 Gy group. Normal tissue effects did not differ significantly between 41Â·6 Gy and 50 Gy groups. START-B enrolled 2215 women. Median follow-up was 9Â·9 years (IQR 7Â·5-10Â·1), after which 95 local-regional relapses had occurred. The proportion of patients with local-regional relapse at 10 years did not differ significantly between the 40 Gy group (4Â·3\%, 95\% CI 3Â·2-5Â·9) and the 50 Gy group (5Â·5\%, 95\% CI 4Â·2-7Â·2; HR 0Â·77, 95\% CI 0Â·51-1Â·16; p=0Â·21). In START-B, breast shrinkage, telangiectasia, and breast oedema were significantly less common normal tissue effects in the 40 Gy group than in the 50 Gy group. Interpretation: Long-term follow-up confirms that appropriately dosed hypofractionated radiotherapy is safe and effective for patients with early breast cancer. The results support the continued use of 40 Gy in 15 fractions, which has already been adopted by most UK centres as the standard of care for women requiring adjuvant radiotherapy for invasive early breast cancer.

abstract = {PURPOSE: The GEANT4 general-purpose Monte Carlo simulation toolkit is able to simulate physical interaction processes of electrons, hydrogen and helium atoms with charge states (H0, H+) and (He0, He+, He2+), respectively, in liquid water, the main component of biological systems, down to the electron volt regime and the submicrometer scale, providing GEANT4 users with the so-called "GEANT4-DNA" physics models suitable for microdosimetry simulation applications. The corresponding software has been recently re-engineered in order to provide GEANT4 users with a coherent and unique approach to the simulation of electromagnetic interactions within the GEANT4 toolkit framework (since GEANT4 version 9.3 beta). This work presents a quantitative comparison of these physics models with a collection of experimental data in water collected from the literature. METHODS: An evaluation of the closeness between the total and differential cross section models available in the GEANT4 toolkit for microdosimetry and experimental reference data is performed using a dedicated statistical toolkit that includes the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test. The authors used experimental data acquired in water vapor as direct measurements in the liquid phase are not yet available in the literature. Comparisons with several recommendations are also presented. RESULTS: The authors have assessed the compatibility of experimental data with GEANT4 microdosimetry models by means of quantitative methods. The results show that microdosimetric measurements in liquid water are necessary to assess quantitatively the validity of the software implementation for the liquid water phase. Nevertheless, a comparison with existing experimental data in water vapor provides a qualitative appreciation of the plausibility of the simulation models. The existing reference data themselves should undergo a critical interpretation and selection, as some of the series exhibit significant deviations from each other. CONCLUSIONS: The GEANT4-DNA physics models available in the GEANT4 toolkit have been compared in this article to available experimental data in the water vapor phase as well as to several published recommendations on the mass stopping power. These models represent a first step in the extension of the GEANT4 Monte Carlo toolkit to the simulation of biological effects of ionizing radiation.},

abstract = {Purpose: Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been shown to cause sensitization with kilovoltage (kV) radiation. Differences in the absorption coefficient between gold and soft tissue, as a function of photon energy, predict that maximum enhancement should occur in the kilovoltage (kV) range, with almost no enhancement at megavoltage (MV) energies. Recent studies have shown that GNPs are not biologically inert, causing oxidative stress and even cell death, suggesting a possible biological mechanism for sensitization. The purpose of this study was to assess GNP radiosensitization at clinically relevant MV X-ray energies. Methods and Materials: Cellular uptake, intracellular localization, and cytotoxicity of GNPs were assessed in normal L132, prostate cancer DU145, and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Radiosensitization was measured by clonogenic survival at kV and MV photon energies and MV electron energies. Intracellular DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and DNA repair were determined and GNP chemosensitization was assessed using the radiomimetic agent bleomycin. Results: GNP uptake occurred in all cell lines and was greatest in MDA-MB-231 cells with nanoparticles accumulating in cytoplasmic lysosomes. In MDA-MB-231 cells, radiation sensitizer enhancement ratios (SERs) of 1.41, 1.29, and 1.16 were achieved using 160 kVp, 6 MV, and 15 MV X-ray energies, respectively. No significant effect was observed in L132 or DU145 cells at kV or MV energies (SER 0.97-1.08). GNP exposure did not increase radiation-induced DSB formation or inhibit DNA repair; however, GNP chemosensitization was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with bleomycin (SER 1.38). Conclusions: We have demonstrated radiosensitization in MDA-MB-231 cells at MV X-ray energies. The sensitization was cell-specific with comparable effects at kV and MV energies, no increase in DSB formation, and GNP chemopotentiation with bleomycin, suggesting a possible biological mechanism of radiosensitization.

abstract = {Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been shown to sensitize cancer cells to x-ray radiation, particularly at kV energies where photoelectric interactions dominate and the high atomic number of gold makes a large difference to x-ray absorption. Protons have a high cross-section for gold at a large range of relevant clinical energies, and so potentially could be used with GNPs for increased therapeutic effect.Here, we investigate the contribution of secondary electron emission to cancer cell radiosensitization and investigate how this parameter is affected by proton energy and a free radical scavenger. We simulate the emission from a realistic cell phantom containing GNPs after traversal by protons and x-rays with different energies. We find that with a range of proton energies (1-250âMeV) there is a small increase in secondaries compared to a much larger increase with x-rays. Secondary electrons are known to produce toxic free radicals. Using a cancer cell line in vitro we find that a free radical scavenger has no protective effect on cells containing GNPs irradiated with 3âMeV protons, while it does protect against cells irradiated with x-rays. We conclude that GNP generated free radicals are a major cause of radiosensitization and that there is likely to be much less dose enhancement effect with clinical proton beams compared to x-rays.},

abstract = {Successful treatment of brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is limited in large part by the cumulative dose of Radiation Therapy (RT) that can be safely given and the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits the delivery of systemic anticancer agents into tumor tissue. Consequently, the overall prognosis remains grim. Herein, we report our pilot studies in cell culture experiments and in an animal model of GBM in which RT is complemented by PEGylated-gold nanoparticles (GNPs). GNPs significantly increased cellular DNA damage inflicted by ionizing radiation in human GBM-derived cell lines and resulted in reduced clonogenic survival (with dose-enhancement ratio of â¼1.3). Intriguingly, combined GNP and RT also resulted in markedly increased DNA damage to brain blood vessels. Follow-up in vitro experiments confirmed that the combination of GNP and RT resulted in considerably increased DNA damage in brain-derived endothelial cells. Finally, the combination of GNP and RT increased survival of mice with orthotopic GBM tumors. Prior treatment of mice with brain tumors resulted in increased extravasation and in-tumor deposition of GNP, suggesting that RT-induced BBB disruption can be leveraged to improve the tumor-tissue targeting of GNP and thus further optimize the radiosensitization of brain tumors by GNP. These exciting results together suggest that GNP may be usefully integrated into the RT treatment of brain tumors, with potential benefits resulting from increased tumor cell radiosensitization to preferential targeting of tumor-associated vasculature.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: An approach known as gold nanoparticle-aided radiation therapy (GNRT) is a recent development in radiation therapy which seeks to make a tumor more susceptible to radiation damage by modifying its photon interaction properties with an infusion of gold nanoparticles (GNPs). The purpose of this study was to quantify the energy deposition due to secondary electrons from GNPs on a nanometer scale and to calculate the corresponding microscopic dose enhancement factor around GNPs. METHODS: The Monte Carlo code EGSnrc was modified to obtain the spectra of secondary electrons from atoms of gold approximating GNPs and molecules of water under photon irradiation of a tumor loaded with GNPs. Six different photon sources were used: 125I, 103Pd, 169Yb, 192Ir, 50 kVp, and 6 MV x rays. Treating the scored electron spectra as point sources within an infinite medium of water, the event-by-event Monte Carlo code NOREC was used to quantify the radial dose distribution, giving rise to gold/water electron dose point kernels and corresponding microscopic dose enhancement factors. These kernels were applied to a test case based on a scanning electron microscope image of a GNP distribution in tissue, enabling the determination of the microscopic dose enhancement at each dose point. RESULTS: For the lower energy sources 125I, 103Pd, 169Yb, and 50 kVp, the secondary electron fluence within a GNP-loaded tumor was increased by as much as two orders of magnitude, leading to two orders of magnitude increase in electron energy deposition over radial distances up to 10 microm. For the test case considered, the dose was enhanced by factors ranging from 2 to 20 within 5 microm of GNPs, and by 5\% as far away as 30 microm. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a remarkable microscopic dose enhancement due to GNPs and low energy photon sources. By quantifying the microscopic dose enhancement factor for a given photon source as a function of distance from GNPs, it also enables the selection of either a passive or an active tumor targeting strategy using GNPs which will maximize the radiobiological benefit from GNRT.},

abstract = {The impact of protons on metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) produces the potent release of MNP-induced secondary electrons and characteristic x-rays. To determine the ability of secondary radiations to enhance proton treatment, the therapeutic irradiation of tumors was investigated in mice receiving 100-300 mg MNPs/kg intravenously prior to single dose, 10-41 Gy, proton irradiation. A proton beam was utilized to irradiate nanoparticles with a single Bragg peak set to occur inside a tumor volume (fully absorbed) or to occur after the beam had traversed the entire body. The dose-dependent increase in complete tumor regression (CTR) was 37-62\% in the fully-absorbed irradiation group or 50-100\% in the traversing irradiation group, respectively, compared with the proton-alone control mice (p < 0.01). One year survival was 58-100\% versus 11-13\% proton alone. The dose-dependent increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species level was 12-36\% at 10 Gy compared with the proton-alone control cell. Therapeutic effective drug concentration that led to 100\% CTR with a proton dose of 31 Gy was measured either 41 Âµg Au/g tissue or 59 Âµg Fe/g tissue. MNP-based proton treatment increased not only percent CTR and survival in vivo but also ROS generation in vitro, suggesting tumor dose enhancement from secondary radiation as one potent pathway of therapeutic enhancement.},

Cell uptake and radiation cytotoxicity enhancement in a breast-cancer cell line (MCF-7) versus a nonmalignant breast-cell line (MCF-10A) are studied. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results show that cancer cells take up functional Glu-GNPs significantly more than naked GNPs. The TEM results also indicate that AET-capped GNPs are mostly bound to the MCF-7 cell membrane, while Glu-GNPs enter the cells and are distributed in the cytoplasm. After MCF-7 cell uptake of Glu-GNPs, or binding of AET-GNPs, the in vitro cytotoxicity effects are observed at 24, 48, and 72 hours. The results show that these functional GNPs have little or no toxicity to these cells. To validate the enhanced killing effect on cancer cells, various forms of radiation are applied such as 200 kVp X-rays and gamma-rays, to the cells, both with and without functional GNPs. By comparison with irradiation alone, the results show that GNPs significantly enhance cancer killing.},

We developed a Monte Carlo-based AuNP radiosensitization predictive model (ARP), which takes into account the detailed energy deposition at the nano-scale. This model was compared to experimental cell survival and macroscopic dose enhancement predictions. PC-3 prostate cancer cell survival was characterized after irradiation using a 300Â kVp photon source with and without AuNPs present in the cell culture media. Detailed Monte Carlo simulations were conducted, producing individual tracks of photoelectric products escaping AuNPs and energy deposition was scored in nano-scale voxels in a model cell nucleus. Cell survival in our predictive model was calculated by integrating the radiation induced lethal event density over the nucleus volume. Experimental AuNP radiosensitization was observed with a sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) of 1.21 Â± 0.13. SERs estimated using the ARP model and the macroscopic enhancement model were 1.20 Â± 0.12 and 1.07 Â± 0.10 respectively. In the hypothetical case of AuNPs localized within the nucleus, the ARP model predicted a SER of 1.29 Â± 0.13, demonstrating the influence of AuNP intracellular localization on radiosensitization.},

abstract = {Purpose: Study density of ionization in cells containing gold nanoparticles (AuNP) submitted to Radiation Therapy. Methods: Spherical gold nanoparticles with diameters ranging 0-100nm were considered evenly distributed inside a 20Âµm cubic cell, maintaining the gold concentration of 0.01\%, with constant number of gold atoms inside the cell. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using PENELOPE code considering event-by-event transport of secondary electrons with minimum energy of 1keV. Simulated clinical energy spectrum of 250kV and 6MV x-rays;Co-60 and Ir-192 ?-ray sources obtained at each corresponding build-up depths were considered. Density of ionization inside the cell was evaluated counting delta electrons created either in AuNP or cell, excluding electrons attenuated inside the nanoparticles. The dose enhancement resultant from interaction of electrons with few micrometers range was quantified by the factor ÂµDEF as the ratio of doses inside the cell with and without AuNP. Results: Maps of ionization density were obtained at the central plane of the cell illustrating ionizations around and between AuNP. The density of ionization increases in cell medium as the AuNP diameter enlarges, being higher to larger nanoparticles for all energies studied. The total dose deposited in the cell is affected by the fraction of electrons consumed in the nanoparticles, resulting in size-dependence for ÂµDEF. The ÂµDEFs for 250kV are 1.68 to 20nm, 1.83 to 60nm and 1.72 to 100nm; ÂµDEFs for 6MV are 1.14 to 20nm, 1.38 to 60nm and 1.20 to 100nm, therefore presenting an optimum nanoparticle size for clinical applications in Radiation Therapy. Conclusions: The ÂµDEF describes dose enhancements founded on the effective density of ionizations inside cell medium containing AuNP, considering real electron tracks close to metallic interfaces. The profile of ionizations describes electron spectra of electrons with intracellular range considering dynamics of creation and consumption, hence being directly proportional to potential applicability of AuNP in Radiation Therapy.},

abstract = {A recent paper by Lechtman et al (2011 Phys. Med. Biol. 56 4631-47) presented Monte Carlo modelling of gold nanoparticle dose modification. In it, they predict that the introduction of gold nanoparticles has the strongest effect with x-rays at kilovoltage energies, and that negligible increases in dose are expected at megavoltage energies. While these results are in agreement with others in the literature (including those produced by our group), the conclusion that â(gold nanoparticle) radiosensitization using a 6 MV photon source is not clinically feasibleâ appears to conflict with recently published experimental studies which have shown radiosensitization using 6 MV x-ray sources with relatively low gold concentrations. The increasing disparity between theoretical predictions of dose enhancement and experimental results in the field of gold nanoparticle radiosensitization suggests that, while the ability of gold nanoparticles to modify dose within a tumour volume is well understood, the resulting radiosensitization is not simply correlated with this measure. This highlights the need to validate theoretical predictions of this kind against experimental measurements, to ensure that the scenarios and values being modelled are meaningful within a therapeutic context.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: The addition of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) to tumours leads to an increase in dose due to their high density and energy absorption coefficient, making it a potential radiosensitiser. However, experiments have observed radiosensitisations significantly larger than the increase in dose alone, including at megavoltage energies where gold's relative energy absorption is lowest. This work investigates whether GNPs create dose inhomogeneities on a sub-cellular scale which combine with non-linear dose dependence of cell survival to be the source of radiosensitisation at megavoltage energies. Materials and methods: Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to calculate dose in the vicinity of a single GNP on the nanoscale. The effect of this nanoscale dose distribution was then modelled for MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to 2 nm GNPs, and compared to experimental results. Results: Dramatic dose inhomogeneities occur around GNPs exposed to megavoltage radiation. When analysed using the Local Effect Model, these inhomogeneities lead to significant radiosensitisation, in agreement with experimental results. Conclusions: This work suggests that GNP radiosensitisation is driven by inhomogeneities in dose on the nanoscale, rather than changes in dose over the entire cell, which may contribute to the similar radiosensitisation observed in megavoltage and kilovoltage experiments. The short range of these inhomogeneities and the variation in enhancement in different cells suggests sub-cellular localisation is important in determining GNP radiosensitisation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study gold nanoparticles have been used as a permanent marker of implanted normal and malignant cell grafts in combination with a suitable x-ray apparatus. Using x-ray computed tomography the micrometric three-dimensional distribution of these marked cells could be displayed with penetration depth, high cell sensitivity and high spatial resolution in rodent models of human diseases. In principle the method allows quantification of cell numbers at any anatomical location over time in small animals.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gold nanoparticles have been used as radiation dose enhancing materials in recent investigations. In the current study, dose enhancement effect of gold nanoparticles on tumor cells was evaluated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used MCNPX code for MC modeling in the current study. A water phantom and a tumor region with a size of 1Ã1Ã1 cm3 loaded with gold nanoparticles were simulated. The macroscopic dose enhancement factor was calculated for gold nanoparticles with sizes of 30, 50, and 100 nm. Also, we simulated different photon beams including mono-energetic beams (50-120 keV), a Cobalt-60 beam, 6 \& 18 MV photon beams of a conventional linear accelerator.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found a dose enhancement factor (DEF) of from 1.4 to 3.7 for monoenergetic kilovoltage beams, while the DEFs for megavoltage beams were negligible and less than 3\% for all GNP sizes and concentrations. The optimum energy for higher DEF was found to be the 90 keV monoenergetic beam. The effect of GNP size was not considerable, but the GNP concentration had a substantial impact on achieved DEF in GNP-based radiation therapy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The results were in close agreement with some previous studies considering the effect of photon energy and GNP concentration on observed DEF. Application of GNP-based radiation therapy using kilovoltage beams is recommended.},

abstract = {We present numerical simulations of X-ray emission and absorption in a biological environment for which we have modified the general-purpose computer code Geant4. The underlying mechanism rests on the use of heavy nanoparticles delivered to specific sites, such as cancerous tumors, and treated with monoenergetic X-rays at resonant atomic and molecular transitions. X-ray irradiation of high-Z atoms results in Auger decays of photon emission and electron ejections creating multiple electron vacancies. These vacancies may be filled either be radiative decays from higher electronic shells or by excitations from the K-shell at resonant energies by an external X-ray source, as described in an accompanying paper by Pradhan et al. in this volume. Our Monte Carlo models assume normal body material embedded with a layer of gold nanoparticles. The simulation results presented in this paper demonstrate that resonant excitations via Kalpha, Kbeta, etc., transitions result in a considerable enhancement in localized X-ray energy deposition at the layer with gold nanoparticles, compared with nonresonant processes and energies. The present results could be applicable to in vivo therapy and diagnostics (theranostics) of cancerous tumors using high-Z nanoparticles and monochromatic X-ray sources according to the resonant theranostics (RT) methodology.},

abstract = {Iodinated contrast agents, which are routinely used to improve contrast in x-ray diagnostic radiography, have been successfully proven to enhance radiation effects in kilovoltage x-ray radiation therapy beams. The studies determined the influence of iodine on the level of radiation biotoxicity to cells as an indicator of the radiation dose enhancement. The use of other high-atomic-number materials such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) may also provide advantages in terms of radiation dose enhancement. In this work AuNPs have been used for the enhancement of radiation effects on bovine aortic endothelial cells of superficial x-ray radiation therapy and megavoltage electron radiation therapy beams. Results reveal an increase of cell damage with increasing concentration of AuNPs. At 1 mM concentration of AuNPs, enhancement of radiation peaked at 25 times for a kilovoltage x-ray beam. AuNPs showed similar effects on electron beams but to a lesser extent. This study showed that AuNPs can be used to enhance the effect of radiation doses from kilovoltage x-ray radiation therapy and megavoltage electron radiation therapy beams. In the prevailing clinical circumstances, wherein radiation therapy dose is constrained by normal tissue tolerance, this enhancement could in the future be used to improve local control in superficial x-ray treatments, megavoltage electron beam radiation therapy, microbeam radiation therapy, and intraoperative irradiation using kilovoltage x-rays or megavoltage electron beams. Moreover, the value of this work also stems from the fact that the damage to the endothelial cells lining the highly vasculature structure of tumors deprives tumors of their oxygen and nutrients supply and enhances the efficiency of radiation therapy treatment, where it has been proven that more of the AuNPs injected into animals ends up into the blood than in the tumor.

abstract = {Ionizing radiation damages DNA and also induces oxidative stress, which can affect the function of proteins involved in DNA repair, thereby causing repair of DNA damage to become less efficient. We previously developed a mathematical model of this potentially synergistic relationship and applied it to $\gamma$-ray exposure data on the radiation-resistant prokaryote Deinococcus radiodurans. Here, we investigate the effects of radiation quality on these processes by applying the model to data on exposures of D. radiodurans to heavy ions with linear energy transfer (LET) of 18.5-11,300 keV/$\mu$m. The model adequately describes these data using three parameters combinations: radiogenic DNA damage induction, repair protein inactivation and cellular repair capacity. Although statistical uncertainties around best-fit parameter estimates are substantial, the behaviors of model parameters are consistent with current knowledge of LET effects: inactivation cross-sections for both DNA and proteins increase with increasing LET; DNA damage yield per unit of radiation dose also increases with LET; protein damage per unit dose tends to decrease with LET; DNA and especially protein damage yields are reduced when cells are irradiated in the dry state. These results suggest that synergism between oxidative stress and DNA damage may play an important role not only during $\gamma$-ray exposure, but during high-LET radiation exposure as well.},

Four hundred and eighty clinical beams were studied for different potential cellular or sub-cellular targets. Beam quality was determined based on a 6 MV linac with and without a flattening filter for various delivery conditions. Dose enhancement ratios DER = D(GNP)/D(water) were calculated for all cases using the GEANT4 Monte Carlo code and the CEPXS/ONEDANT radiation transport deterministic code. Dose enhancement using GEANT4 agreed with CEPXS/ONEDANT. DER for unflattened beams is â¼2 times larger than for flattened beams. The maximum DER values were calculated for split-IMRT fields (â¼6) and for out-of-field areas of an unflattened linac (â¼17). In-field DER values, at the surface of gold nanoparticles, ranged from 2.2 to 4.2 (flattened beam) and from 3 to 4.7 (unflattened beams). For a GNP cluster with thicknesses of 10 and 100 nm, the DER ranges from 14\% to 287\%. DER is the greatest for split-IMRT, larger depths, out-of-field areas and/or unflattened linac. Mapping of a GNP location in tumor and normal tissue is essential for efficient and safe delivery of nanoparticle-enhanced radiotherapy.},

abstract = {Gold nanoparticles can enhance the biological effective dose of radiation delivered to tumors, but few data exist to quantify this effect. The purpose of this project was to build a Monte Carlo simulation model to study the degree of dose enhancement achievable with gold nanoparticles. A Monte Carlo simulation model was first built using Geant4 code. An Ir-192 brachytherapy source in a water phantom was simulated and the calculation model was first validated against previously published data. We then introduced up to 10(13) gold nanospheres per cm(3) into the water phantom and examined their dose enhancement effect. We compared this enhancement against a gold-water mixture model that has been previously used to attempt to quantify nanoparticle dose enhancement. In our benchmark test, dose-rate constant, radial dose function, and two-dimensional anisotropy function calculated with our model were within 2\% of those reported previously. Using our simulation model we found that the radiation dose was enhanced up to 60\% with 10(13) gold nanospheres per cm(3) (9.6\% by weight) in a water phantom selectively around the nanospheres. The comparison study indicated that our model more accurately calculated the dose enhancement effect and that previous methodologies overestimated the dose enhancement up to 16\%. Monte Carlo calculations demonstrate that biologically-relevant radiation dose enhancement can be achieved with the use of gold nanospheres. Selective tumor labeling with gold nanospheres may be a strategy for clinically enhancing radiation effects.},
